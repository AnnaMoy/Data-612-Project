# Project Plan for Final Project

# Dataset
The dataset we are using is from Kaggle - [Movielens 100k] (https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/abhikjha/movielens-100k). The data consistent of 100k ratings and 600 users. 

* Ratings - userid, movieid, rating, timestamp
* Movies - movieid, title, genres
* Tags - userid, movieid, tag, timestamp

# Recommender Plan

We are going to use a scalable hybrid recommender system for the movie dataset to provide more accuracy and personalization for the movie recommender. Our goal is to use collaborative filtering and then user Alternating Least Squares(ALS) by implementing it in Apache Spark using the sparklyr package in r. As a unique element, we incorporate content-based filtering by combining movie genres and user-generated tags to capture movie similarity, adding richer content features to complement the collaborative filtering model.
